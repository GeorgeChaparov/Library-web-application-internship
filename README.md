# Library-web-application-internship

This web application was developed for the Regional Library "Luben Karavelov" in Ruse, Bulgaria, to log and display the library's activities, projects, and articles. The app allows users to browse through the latest articles, search by date or title, and access detailed content pages for both articles and projects. It also includes an admin panel for authorized users to manage content efficiently.

Key Features:

    Dynamic Landing Page: Displays a banner that rotates every 3 seconds and highlights the latest articles with card layouts showing title, description, and date.

    Article & Project Sections: Users can browse articles and projects, with projects supporting additional file uploads (PDFs).

    Search Functionality: Users can search for articles and projects by title or date using flexible date formats (day, month, year).

    Admin Panel: Provides authorized users with content management capabilities, including editing, creating, and deleting articles and projects. The admin view supports searching by article/project ID.

    SQLite Database: The app uses an SQLite database to store and manage articles, projects, and admin data efficiently.

    Node.js with Express: The back-end is built using Node.js with the Express framework to handle server-side logic and routing.
    

This project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js (with Express), and SQLite for the database, with a focus on user-friendly navigation and content management.
